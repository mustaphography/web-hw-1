        In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly
        rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a
        brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by
        transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole. But first,
        Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and a
        team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find
        out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.
